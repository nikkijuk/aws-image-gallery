# aws_image_gallery

aws image gallery app

## Getting Started

This project is based on [AWS Amplify Flutter hand-on lab](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-flutter-app-amplify/).

## AWS Amplify Flutter

At the time this repository was created [AWS Amplify Flutter](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter) was at developer preview and supported limited set of services.

- Authentication with [Amazon AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/)
- Storage with Amazon [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- Analytics with [Amazon AWS Pinpoint](https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)

It's important to study [current roadmap](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/issues/5) to understand future directions and ideas behind development.

Important: current focus is at Mobile and IOS & Android parity, not at Desktop or Web

> Q. Will web and Desktop platform be supported?
> Not right away, our goal with this design is to keep the architecture flexible such that more platforms can be supported in the future.
